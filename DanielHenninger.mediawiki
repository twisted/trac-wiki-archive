You probably know me more as Jadestorm than as Daniel Henninger.  Either way, outside of work, I have a lot of active Jabber related projects that I am involved in.  The "biggest" of them are:

* PyAIMt (Python Jabber Transport for AIM)

* PyICQt (Python Jabber Transport for ICQ)

* JWGC (Jabber WindowGram Client)

* Jabber Script Repository

I am also the maintainer of the oscar functionality in Words, though I have not yet passed any code back to the project.  (I have been working on it within PyICQt/PyAIMt, and will prep things to be returned to Twisted Words at some point in the hopefully near future)
