= Building Twisted on Windows =


This contains information for building Twisted on Windows


== Installation requirements ==

You will need a standard Python 3 dev environment. See the official documentation at https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html

Download Visual Studio Installer and get the following components for C++ build tools (might use newer versions):

* MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ build tools
* Windows 10 SDK

You can get Python 3 via nuget.

Also get Git for Windows.


== Dev process ===

I am making sure pip script is installed with `python -m pip install -U pip` as the default python might be created with only the pip module and without the pip script.
