  * `twisted.web._newclient.Request.writeTo` returns a `Deferred` which fires when the request has been completely written to the transport.  If the connection is lost and a request is in the process of writing itself out, it should be told to stop.  This could be done by canceling the `Deferred` returned by `writeTo`.  It is currently done by having a separate method on `Request` (requiring extra state tracking).
